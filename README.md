#What is Tennis Mission?

Tennis Mission is a Web Application that functions as a tennis expert. The user (tennis player) must first sign up where login information is stored in a MongoDB database.
Then, the user shall input statistics taken from a tennis match. Hence, a unique algorithm developed by myself will return a set of strings
that point out the weaknesses of that tennis player. Simultaneously, it posts the results, along with the name of the player, into a page
where tennis couches could take a look at the results then chat with the tennis player (Quicblox API integration).
